The object of research is the classification of damage to car windows.
Sometimes people get into car accidents and to avoid large losses for car repairs, cars are often insured. After each case, the insurance company needs to determine what kind of damage is present on the car. Usually, damage is present on the windshield or rear window.

However, understanding what exactly this damage is and what needs to be done with it is not a trivial task at all and requires skilled workers.
The purpose of the work is to create a simple and flexible solution based on a web application, which would make it very easy to create confirmation for insurance companies regarding the type of damage.

A key feature of the program is the ability to automatically determine the category of damage so that the application can work independently of people who are carriers of knowledge. This will significantly speed up and reduce the cost of a large number of insurance companies and their intermediaries.
